Improved Tracker Functionality.
In this lab, I've added the ability for the tracker to emit an event when
a new exercise is set.  In a fully-featured application we could respond to
this event in a variety of ways. For now we are just going to re-

Activities:  Walk/Run/Swim
Input:  Exercise type
        Distance (miles)
        Weight (lbs)
        Time (minutes)
Output: Calories Burned
